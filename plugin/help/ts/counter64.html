Increments the numbered 64 bit counter. These counters are readable via SNMP, and can be graphed on the Current Activity page on the Administration Server. 64 bit counters exist in a separate name- and storage space from the 32 bit counters, i.e. they don't overlap in any way. <br/> By default, the counter is incremented by one, but you can also supply an amount to increment the counter by. If a negative amount is supplied the counter is decremented, but please keep in mind that a decrement is indiscernible from a wrap-around. Also please note that the supplied increment amount is limited to signed 32 bit range even though the counter is 64 bit.

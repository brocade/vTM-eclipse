Issues an HTTP DELETE request for a remote web page. $1 is set to the HTTP response code (e.g. 204 for OK), or is 0 if there was an error. $2 is set to the Content-Type of the response (or an error message if there was an error).  $3 is set to the content-headers of the response, in the format: [&lt;header-line&gt;\r\n]*.  $4 is set to the first line of the HTTP response.  The entire original response may be reconstructed as $4."\r\n".$3."\r\n".$body, where $body is the result of http.request.get. <br/> HTTPS pages can be requested by using the https:// prefix for the url. <br/> A timeout parameter can be given (in seconds). If the request does not complete in this time, then an error will be given instead. <br/> Requests made with http.request.delete() will use keepalive connections to the destination server.  Provided the request was completed successfully, these keepalive connections will be re-used by any invocation of http.request.delete(), http.request.head() or http.request.get() to the same destination host:port, from any rule, in any virtual server.  If the request is to a node in a pool, the connection will be shared with other requests your traffic manager makes to the same node. If the request made with http.request.delete() was unsuccessful, your traffic manager closes the connection.

      The Zeus Viewer lists the currently open connections to one or more 
      traffic managers.  
      This is presented as a tree structure, listing the rules associated with a 
      Zeus project underneath it.  If you are connected to one or more traffic 
      manager, you will be able to view and manipulate the rules associated with 
      them here.

      There are two icons at the top of this pane each with a green cross symbol, 
      one to add a new Zeus project, and one to add a new rule.  More details 
      of these can be found at <a href="viewer/newrules.html">Adding New Rules</a> and 
      <a href="connecting.html">Connecting to a Traffic Manager</a>. You can

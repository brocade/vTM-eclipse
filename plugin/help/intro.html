      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>
      The Zeus Eclipse plug-in allows the development of TrafficScript rules 
      inside the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
      </p>
      
      <p>
      This help guide contains information regarding how to use the plug-in,
      and what TrafficScript functions are available.  A full function reference 
      is also provided.
      </p>
      
      <h3>How does Eclipse communicate with Zeus software?</h3>
      
      <p>
      Eclipse communicates using the Zeus SOAP API, and automatically 
      synchronises a locally stored copy of the rules catalog with the remote 
      traffic manager. This means you can make any changes you want through the 
      plug-in and the traffic manager will be updated accordingly.  Equally, 
      changes made to rules on the traffic manager will be mirrored within the 
      Eclipse plug-in. If this occurs, Eclipse will warn you that something has
      changed.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Full TrafficScript syntax checking is provided, as is context-sensitive
      help.  More details of these features are provided in this help guide.

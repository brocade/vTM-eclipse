      <h2>Task Marker Preferences</h2>
      <p>
         The Task marker page lists the tags which are automatically
         marked in Eclipse's task view. This page is located in the
         preference dialog under Zeus -&gt; Editor -&gt; Task Markers.
      </p>
      <p>
         The buttons on this page allow you to add, edit and delete 
         the task tags. The priority of a tag changes how it is 
         displayed in Eclipse's task view.

      <h2>Code Assistance Preferences</h2>      
      <p>
         Code assistance options change how the TrafficScript editor provides
         contextual help whilst you are editing code. It is located in 
         Eclipse's preference dialog under Zeus -&gt; Editor -&gt; Code 
         Assistance.
      </p>

      <h3>Mouse Hover</h3>
      <p>
         This section allows you to pick what information is shown when hovering 
         the mouse pointer over text in the TrafficScript editor. Un-check all
         options to disable the information pop-up completely.
      </p>

      <h3>Auto Complete</h3>
      <p>
         The TrafficScript editor can display possible completions for
         your code as you type. You can choose what kinds of suggestion
         are displayed, or un-check all types to disable auto-completion
         entirely.
      </p>

      <h3>Parameter Popup</h3>
      <p>
         The editor displays the parameters for a function when you are
         editing them. In this preference section you can enable or disable
         this popup, and alter the pause before it is first displayed.

      <h2>The Zeus Perspective</h2>
      
      <h3>What is a perspective and why do I need one?</h3>

      </p>
      
      <p>
      A perspective is a group of views and editors in the main Eclipse window that
      make up an environment suitable for a particular development purpose.
      The Zeus plug-in provides a suitable perspective for TrafficScript rule 
      development, and this can be selected via the menu bar under "Window -&gt; 
      Open Perspective -&gt; Other.." or by clicking the 'Add perspective' icon
      in the Selector and choosing 'Other...'. If you have correctly installed 
      the Zeus plug-in, the Zeus perspective should be available in the 
      subsequent list.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Once selected, Zeus will be added to the list of available perspectives, and the 
      windows and icons will arrange themselves into the structure defined within 
      the perspective, ready for use. Zeus will appear as the current perspective 
      in the Selector control.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The Zeus perspective is made up of three main window panes:
      <ul>
      <li>A general <a href="editor.html">Editor</a> window in the centre</li>
      <li>The <a href="viewer.html">Zeus Viewer</a> and Navigator on the left</li>
      <li>The <a href="editor/errors.html">Problems</a> and <a href="editor/tasks.html">Tasks</a> views at the bottom</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <img src="images/main.png" alt="Main window" />
      <p>

      </p> 
      
      <h3>The Zeus Viewer and Navigator pane</h3>
      
      <p>
      The Zeus Viewer tab will list the currently active Zeus projects, and 
      the rules associated with each one. This pane allows you to manipulate 
      (copy/move/delete etc) the rules by using the right mouse menu or dragging 
      them.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The Navigator tab is an alternative view of the same information, but given
      as a file system.  Each Zeus project will still appear, but rules will
      be listed under a Rules sub-folder.  This sub-folder is essentially a short-cut
      (or symbolic link) to indicate that these rules exist on a Zeus instance, and
      not actually on your local file-system.  Note how each rule has the extension
      <b>.zts</b> - simply used to identify files of this type.  The <b>.project</b> and 
      <b>.zxtmConf</b> files are internal plug-in config files and should not 
      be edited manually.
      </p>

      <h3>The Editor pane</h3>
      
      <p>
      The Editor pane provides the means to add or edit rules, and to view the output
      of various other Eclipse operations.
      </p>

      <h3>Problems and Tasks pane</h3>
      
      <p>
      Finally, there is a tasks and problems pane at the bottom of the screen.  
      Any errors, warnings or informational messages encountered are displayed 
      in the Problems tab. Any task labels are displayed in the Tasks tab. More 
      information about Tasks can be found on the <a href="editor/tasks.html">
      Task Markers</a> page.

      <h2>Plug-in Preferences</h2>
      <p>
         The global options for the Zeus plug-in are located in Eclipse's main
         preference dialog (Window -&gt; Preferences) under the Zeus section.
         <br/>
         The main preference page contains SOAP and debugging options for 
         the Zeus plugin.
      </p>
      
      <h3>SOAP Update Interval</h3>
      <p>
         The SOAP update interval controls how much the plug-in contacts Zeus
         to update its internal state. The plug-in keeps a copy of all rules
         synchronised in local memory, therefore decreasing the update interval
         will make the plug-in notice rule changes on a Zeus faster (though it 
         will also slightly increase the load on the Zeus admin server). 
      </p>

      <h3>Support</h3>
      <p>
         These settings are used to debug problems in the plug-in, and should 
         normally be turned off. Turning them on will slow down operations
         performed by the plug-in.

      <h2>Connecting to a Traffic Manager</h2>
        
      <p>
      In order to use the Zeus plug-in, you must first create a connection to
      a working Zeus installation.  This can be done via the 'Add new Zeus project'
      icon in the <a href="viewer.html">Zeus viewer</a> pane.  You will be
      presented with the New Connection dialog box shown below.
      </p>

      <p>
      Fig.1: The new connection dialog
      </p>  
            
      <p>
      A new connection requires you to provide a project name, along with the 
      following Zeus software credentials:
      <ul>
      <li><b>Hostname/IP address</b></li>
      <p>
      This is the hostname or IP address of the Zeus admin server
      </p>
      
      <li><b>Project Location</b></li>
      <p>
      This setting gives you the option to save the new Zeus project somewhere
      other than your current Eclipse project workspace.  You can specify
      an alternative if it suits your needs.
      </p>
      
      <li><b>Port</b></li>
      <p>
      This is the port number of the Zeus admin server. By default this is 9090.
      </p>
      
      <li><b>Admin User</b></li>
      <p>
      The user you want to connect to the Zeus SOAP API with. This user must 
      be a member of the a group with 'Zeus Control API' permissions.
      </p>
      
      <li><b>Admin Password</b></li>
      <p>
      This is the password of the user you are connecting with.
      </p>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      You can choose to save the password with the new connection/project, so
      you are not prompted for it each time you start Eclipse.  This is only 
      recommended if you are sure your locally-stored data is secure.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Provided your credentials are correct, you should be presented with a new
      Zeus project in the Zeus Viewer pane, and a list of the rules will
      appear under each project.  See the <a href="viewer.html">Zeus Viewer</a> help page 
      for more details.

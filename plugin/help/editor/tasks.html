      <h3>What are task markers?</h3>
      
      <p>
      Task markers can be used to generate 'place holders' in your code.  You can use
      certain pre-defined words in comments, such as <b>TODO</b> or <b>FIXME</b>, in order to remind yourself 
      when something needs to be revisited at a later date. These markers will appear in the 'Tasks' 
      tab of the pane at the bottom of the screen.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I use them?</h3>
      
      <p>
      To use task markers in TrafficScript, you first need to tell Eclipse which tags are to be 
      identified.  This can be done in the Zeus section of the Eclipse <a href="../preferences.html">Preferences</a>. Go to the Task
      Markers list and click 'Add...'.  Here you can add or amend your text markers.

      <p>
      When you need to use a tag, simply add a comment using a # (hash) symbol in front of a text tag you've
      previously set up (see above), e.g. <b># TODO Update this later</b>, and save your rule.  This will automatically be
      added to the Task list.  Double-clicking on this entry will take you straight to the location
      of the tag in your rule set.  Note that the actual location is shown in the Task list, so 
      multiple uses of the same tag can be differentiated.

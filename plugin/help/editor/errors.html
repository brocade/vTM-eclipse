      <h2>Problems with your Code</h2>
      <p>
      The editor checks your TrafficScript code when you perform a save, and will refuse to complete 
      the save if there are any errors in the code. Code issues appear in the 'Problems' tab as well 
      as visually marked in the Editor pane.

      </p>
      
      <p>
      If you have multiple errors in your code, double-clicking on a particular error in 
      the <b>Problems</b> tab will take you to the offending line in the rule.
      </p>
      
      <p> 
      In addition to this, hovering the mouse over a marked problem in the editor pane will display a 
      tooltip on the possible problem, e.g. an unknown TrafficScript function as per the example above.

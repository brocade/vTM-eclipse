      <h2>The Editor Window</h2>
      
      <p>
      The editor operates much in the same way as any other standard graphical editor, 
      with all the usual highlighting, cut, copy and paste functionality.  However, the 
      Zeus plug-in includes additional capabilities such as syntax checking and auto-completion.
      See <a href="../editor.html">this page</a> for more details.

      <h3>What happens when saving a rule</h3>
      <p>
      Saving the rule can be done from the File menu, or by using the &lt;CTRL&gt;-&lt;s&gt; 
      key combination.  At this point, the plug-in writes the rule to the traffic manager, and returns
      the results of a syntax check.  Should there be any errors or warnings, these will
      be highlighted accordingly.  The option to revert the changes is made available at
      the bottom of the editor. <b>NOTE:</b> reverting will result in the loss of any changes
      made since the rule was last saved without problems.

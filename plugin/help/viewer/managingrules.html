      <p>
      Rules shown in the Zeus Viewer (and the Navigator) can be cut, copied, pasted
      and dragged between traffic managers in much the same way as any standard file manager.
      You can rename the rules by clicking 'Rename...' in the right-click menu, or
      by pressing &lt;F2&gt;.
      </p>

      <h3>Deleting a rule</h3>

      <p>
      If you wish to delete a rule, right-click on it and select 'Delete' from the menu.
      Or you can just press the &lt;Delete&gt; key on a highlighted rule.

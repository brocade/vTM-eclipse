      <h2>Managing Traffic Managers</h2>
      
      <p>
      All your Zeus projects are displayed in the <a href="../viewer.html">Zeus Viewer</a> pane.  Each connection is
      identified by the <b>hostname</b> and <b>port</b> (the name you gave to the connection when it was 
      created is shown in brackets).  You cannot create more than one connection to a 
      traffic manager.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Disconnecting from a Traffic Manager</h3>
      
      <p>
      If you wish to disconnect from a traffic manager, right-click on it and choose 'Disconnect (Close Project)'.
      This will simply close the connection, yet retain the local Eclipse project files associated with it.
      Disconnecting a project frees up local memory and resources, and stops the 
      plug-in polling the remote admin server.  Disconnected projects are still shown
      in the Zeus Viewer, but are distinguished by a greyed-out icon next to the name and no available rules.
      You can also easily reconnect to a closed Zeus project by right-clicking on it and selecting 
      'Reconnect (Open Project)'.

      <h3>Removing a Zeus project completely</h3>
      
      <p>
      If you wish to remove a Zeus project altogether, you can right-click on it and choose
      'Remove Project'. This will not affect any resources on the remote traffic
      manager.
      </p>

      <h3>Zeus project settings</h3>
      
      <p>
      Individual Zeus project settings can be modified by right-clicking on the entry in the viewer and 
      choosing 'Edit Settings'.  You can review and modify various properties for this project.  
      Specifically, Zeus connection and authentication settings are available by 
      clicking the Zeus link on the left hand pane.  
      Here you can modify the <b>hostname</b>, <b>port</b>, <b>admin user</b> and <b>admin password</b> stored with the project.
